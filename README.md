# are humans random?
Turns out, not really. This little project asks if an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can detect if a randomly generated sequence was made by a human or a pseudo-random RNG.

## Getting Started
Clone, ideally into a clean virtual environment
```
git clone https://github.com/macsencasaus/are-humans-random.git
```
Ensure your environment fulfills all the items in `./requirements`

Start the database instance by running
```
python db.py
```
Then begin the app
```
python run.py
```
